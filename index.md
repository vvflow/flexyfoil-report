## Locomotion of the fish-like foil under own effort

### The fish-like model

The moment of force `Mf` is applied between the first and second
sections by harmonic law, resulting in the bending of the fish body.
This simulates the muscular effort of a fish. The second hinge is elastic
and passive. The flow-structure task is solved.

### The expression of force and moment via the vortex flux from the surfaces

Substituting these expressions into the equations of motion of bodies,
we obtain the equations, which, together with the equations of the
boundary conditions, form a closed linear system of equations. The
solution of this system gives us the values â€‹ of the velocities of all
sections and circulations of new particles simultaneously.

### Conclusion

The methodology of modeling the body self- locomotion under own effort
is developed. A method is applied for the fish-like model with the
elastic hinges. The calculations performed by the developed method have
shown its effectiveness. The dependency of the obtained quasi-
stationary velocity on the elasticity is investigated. It is shown that
very low spring constant of the hinge is not optimal as well as very
high one.
